What is OPENchat
---

OPENchat aims to create a graph where each node can communicate each other. Communication is based to shortest path. So when a node A wants to communicate with a Node B node A has to find the shortest path (following nodes in the graph or directly). Communication will be achieved sending messages or via video communication. Security will be achieved using SSL/TCP sockets,but in later version. At first, simple TCP sockets will be used.
